# JourneysAppiumTest
This is a simple structured Appium Automation project of the Journeys mobile application. 

The project was done with a POM design in mind but has not been implemented fully. It is following the TestNG framwork with hard coded values for the current processes but one can always configure a TestData file or DataProvider to pass the test information.

Please also note that there are other Utils such us a configuration file and test batch suite runner in the form of XML which can be configured to run the automated tests.
